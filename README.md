About the bakery dataset
The dataset consists of 21293 observations from a bakery. The data file contains four variables, Date, Time, Transaction ID and Item. Transaction ID ranges from 1 through 9684. However, there are some skipped numbers in Transaction IDs. Also, there are duplicated entries, as shown in observation # 2 and #3. Besides, the Item contains "Adjustment", "NONE", and "Afternoon with the baker". While the entries of "Adjustment" and "NONE" are straight forward, "Afternoon with the baker" may be a real purchase.
